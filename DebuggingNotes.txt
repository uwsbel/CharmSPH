Cell::createComputes()
    * dx, dy, dz specify which neighbor we are looking at so the are triplets of 1,1,1 or 1,0,1 or -1,-1,-1, etc.

    * What is computesList used for? Why aren't the px,py,pz in the else statement added to the computeArray?

    * The compute for selfInteraction is added in the first iteration in which we enter the if statement.

    * When there is a single chare the if and else statements produce exactly the same triplets of indeces for the chares. Will this also happen with multiple chares? 
        Answer:  No this does not happen. The same set of indeces was being produced because of the periodic boundary and since there was only a single chare it was referencing itself


Single Chare:

    * When working with single chare, interactSPH is never called (which is expected).


Charm++ Bug

    Description: Problem with ./build command. If we give option 3 for compiler flags the build gives us an error. With option 4 it works.
